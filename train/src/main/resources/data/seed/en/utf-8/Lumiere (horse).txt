Racing career


2015: two-year-old season
Lumiere made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 9 July and started the 6/5 favourite against seven opponents. She led from the start, accelerated away from the field approaching the final furlong and won impressively by six lengths from Sharja Queen. The filly was then moved up sharply in class for the Group Two Lowther Stakes at York Racecourse on 20 August and started the 9/4 favourite ahead of the Princess Margaret Stakes winner Besharah. She took the lead soon after the start but was overtaken by Besharah inside the final furlong and was beaten two and a quarter lengths into second place.
On her third and final appearance as a juvenile, Lumiere was one of eight fillies to contest the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket on 26 September and started the 100/30 third choice in the betting behind Besharah and the Duchess of Cambridge Stakes winner Illuminate. A two-horse Irish challenge comprised Alice Springs (third to Minding in the Moyglare Stud Stakes) and the Curragh Stakes winner Bear Cheek. Lumiere took the lead from the start and opened up a clear advantage at half way. She was strongly challenged in the closing stages but stayed on to win by half a length, a head and three quarters of a length from Illuminate, Besharah and Alice Springs. After the race Johnston said "We always thought there was no shortage of stamina but we also know she's very fast and has a tremendous cruising speed. I'm very, very hopeful she can stay a mile".


2016: three-year-old season
Lumiere began her second season in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket on 1 May and started the second favourite in a sixteen-runner field. After starting strongly and disputing the early lead she dropped away quickly in the last three furlongs and finished last behind Minding.
