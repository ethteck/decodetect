In category theory, an end of a functor 
  
    
      
        S
        :
        
          
            C
          
          
            
              o
              p
            
          
        
        ×
        
          C
        
        →
        
          X
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S:\mathbf {C} ^{\mathrm {op} }\times \mathbf {C} \to \mathbf {X} }
   is a universal extranatural transformation from an object e of X to S.
More explicitly, this is a pair 
  
    
      
        (
        e
        ,
        ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (e,\omega )}
  , where e is an object of X and 
  
    
      
        ω
        :
        e
        
          
            
              →
              ¨
            
          
        
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega :e{\ddot {\to }}S}
   is an extranatural transformation such that for every extranatural transformation 
  
    
      
        β
        :
        x
        
          
            
              →
              ¨
            
          
        
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta :x{\ddot {\to }}S}
   there exists a unique morphism 
  
    
      
        h
        :
        x
        →
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle h:x\to e}
   
of X with 
  
    
      
        
          β
          
            a
          
        
        =
        
          ω
          
            a
          
        
        ∘
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta _{a}=\omega _{a}\circ h}
   
for every object a of C.
By abuse of language the object e is often called the end of the functor S (forgetting 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
  ) and is written

  
    
      
        e
        =
        
          ∫
          
            c
          
          

          
        
        S
        (
        c
        ,
        c
        )
        
           or just 
        
        
          ∫
          
            
              C
            
          
          

          
        
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle e=\int _{c}^{}S(c,c){\text{ or just }}\int _{\mathbf {C} }^{}S.}
  Characterization as limit: If X is complete and C is small, the end can be described as the equalizer in the diagram

          ∏
          
            c

            C
          
        
        S
        (
        c

        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \int _{c}S(c,c)\to \prod _{c\in C}S(c,c)\rightrightarrows \prod _{c\to c'}S(c,c'),}
  where the first morphism is induced by 
  
    
      
        S
        (
        c
        ,
        c

    {\displaystyle S(c,c)\to S(c,c')}
   and the second morphism is induced by 
  
    
      
        S
        (
        
          c
          ′

Coend
The definition of the coend of a functor 
  
    
      
        S
        :
        
          
            C
          
          
            
              o
              p
            
          
        
        ×
        
          C
        
        →
        
          X
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S:\mathbf {C} ^{\mathrm {op} }\times \mathbf {C} \to \mathbf {X} }
   is the dual of the definition of an end.
Thus, a coend of S consists of a pair 
  
    
      
        (
        d
        ,
        ζ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (d,\zeta )}
  , where d is an object of  X and 
  
    
      
        ζ
        :
        S
        
          
            
              →
              ¨
            
          
        
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle \zeta :S{\ddot {\to }}d}
  
is an extranatural transformation, such that for every extranatural transformation 
  
    
      
        γ
        :
        S
        
          
            
              →
              ¨
            
          
        
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma :S{\ddot {\to }}x}
   there exists a unique morphism

  
    
      
        g
        :
        d
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle g:d\to x}
   of X with 
  
    
      
        
          γ
          
            a
          
        
        =
        g
        ∘
        
          ζ
          
            a
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma _{a}=g\circ \zeta _{a}}
   for every object a of C.
The coend d of the functor S is written

  
    
      
        d
        =
        
          ∫
          

          
          
            c
          
        
        S
        (
        c
        ,
        c
        )
        
           or 
        
        
          ∫
          

          
          
            
              C
            
          
        
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle d=\int _{}^{c}S(c,c){\text{ or }}\int _{}^{\mathbf {C} }S.}
  Characterization as colimit: Dually, if X is cocomplete and C is small, then the coend can be described as the coequalizer in the diagram

  
    
      
        
          ∫
          
            c
          
        
        S
        (
        c
        ,
        c
        )
        ←
        
          ∐
          
            c
            ∈
            C
          
        
        S
        (
        c
        ,
        c
        )
        ⇇
        
          ∐
          
            c
            →
            
              c
              ′
            
          
        
        S
        (
        
          c
          ′
        
        ,
        c
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \int ^{c}S(c,c)\leftarrow \coprod _{c\in C}S(c,c)\leftleftarrows \coprod _{c\to c'}S(c',c).}
  


Examples
Natural transformations:Suppose we have functors 
  
    
      
        F
        ,
        G
        :

          X
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F,G:\mathbf {C} \to \mathbf {X} }
   then

  
    
      
        
          
            H

        ×
        
          C

    {\displaystyle \mathrm {Hom} _{\mathbf {X} }(F(-),G(-)):\mathbf {C} ^{op}\times \mathbf {C} \to \mathbf {Set} }
  .In this case, the category of sets is complete, so we need only form the equalizer and in this case

  
    
      
        
          ∫
          
            c

  the natural transformations from 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   to 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  .  Intuitively, a natural transformation from 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   to 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
   is a morphism from 
  
    
      
        F
        (
        c
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle F(c)}
   to 
  
    
      
        G
        (
        c
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle G(c)}
   for every 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   in the category with compatibility conditions.  Looking at the equalizer diagram defining the end makes the equivalence clear.

Geometric realizations:Let 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   be a simplicial set.  That is, 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   is a functor

          t
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta ^{\mathrm {op} }\to \mathbf {Set} }
  .  The discrete topology gives a functor 
  
    
      
        
          S
          e
          t

          p
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {Top} }
   is the category of topological spaces.  Moreover, there is a map 
  
    
      
        γ
        :
        Δ
        →

          p
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma :\Delta \to \mathbf {Top} }
   which sends the object 
  
    
      
        [
        n
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [n]}
   of 
  
    
      
        Δ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta }

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n+1}}
  .  Finally there is a functor 
  
    
      
        
          T
          o
          p

          p
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {Top} \times \mathbf {Top} \to \mathbf {Top} }
   which takes the product of two topological spaces.
