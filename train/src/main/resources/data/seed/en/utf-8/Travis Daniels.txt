College career
As a freshman at LSU in 2001, Daniels saw his first action of the season against Tennessee in the SEC Championship game. He was forced into action after an injury to Randall Gay. Prior to his appearance, he was going to redshirt his freshman year. When asked about giving up his redshirt, he said, "I play for the name on my helmet, not the name on the back of my jersey." During the game, he broke up two passes including one in the end zone, but did not record any tackles. In a Sugar Bowl win over Illinois, Daniels played but did not accumulate any statistics.
Daniels was a top backup in the Tigers' secondary as a sophomore, seeing most of his time in nickel and dime packages. A hamstring injury shortened his season, but he did appear in five games in 2002. On the year, Daniels recorded three tackles, including one for a loss. He also broke up one pass and had two quarterback hurries.
Daniels stepped into a starting role in 2003, opening all 14 games for the Tigers as a junior. He started the first six games of the season at free safety before moving to cornerback for the final eight contests after the emergence of LaRon Landry. Daniels recorded 58 tackles, including 6.5 for losses, two sacks, three quarterback hurries and two interceptions. He also led the Tigers with 26 pass breakups. His first interception came just before halftime in a win over Mississippi State, which he returned 48 yards for a score. His other interception came against Arizona.
Daniels set a season-high with seven tackles in a September game against Georgia. In the aforementioned game against Mississippi State, Daniels six tackles, a sack and a forced fumble to his interception. In the BCS National Championship win over Oklahoma, he recorded four tackles including one for a two-yard loss.
In 2004, Daniels and fellow senior Corey Webster combined to form one top cornerback tandems in the nation. Daniels started all 12 games for the Tigers, finishing his career with 26 straight starts. Against Iowa in the Capital One Bowl, he tallied seven tackles. Daniels finished the season with 48 tackles and nine pass break-ups. He participated in the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama following the season.
