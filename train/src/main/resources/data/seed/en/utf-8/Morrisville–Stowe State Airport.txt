In April 2014, the airport closed for four months of improvements, including rebuilding the runway and lighting; it reopened on August 1, with private company Stowe Aviation operating the facility.  The improvements were funded by a $4 million federal grant from the Airport Improvement Project, and made up the first phase of Stowe Aviation's planned upgrades, with $20 million more in private investment to be used to build a new terminal building, maintenance facility, and other supporting infrastructure.Commercial air service resumed in December 2015, when Tradewind Aviation begins service to Westchester County Airport in White Plains, New York.
