The Right Reverend (abbreviations: The Rt Revd; The Rt Rev'd; The Rt Rev.) is a style applied to certain religious figures.

In the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain, it applies to bishops, except that The Most Reverend is used for archbishops (elsewhere, all Roman Catholic bishops are styled as The Most Reverend).
In some churches with a Presbyterian heritage, it applies to the current Moderator of the General Assembly, such as
the current Moderator of the United Church of Canada
the current Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland
the current Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland
the current Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of East Africa
the current Moderator of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Ghana
the current Moderator of the Sutlej Reformed Church of PakistanIn the Catholic Church, it applies to abbots of monasteries in the Latin Church and archimandrites in the Eastern Catholic Churches. Monsignors of the ranks of protonotary apostolic and domestic prelate were formerly styled The Right Reverend Monsignor, but the currently correct style for them is The Reverend Monsignor.
In the Eastern Orthodox tradition, bishops are styled "The Right Reverend" whether they are heads of dioceses or vicar bishops. The title is also used for archimandrite-level monastics and for some married priests holding the title of protopresbyter.
In Methodism, as in the Anglican tradition, the style is also applied to bishops of the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. Other Methodist denominations, including the United Methodist Church, only use this to refer to district superintendents, not their bishops.
