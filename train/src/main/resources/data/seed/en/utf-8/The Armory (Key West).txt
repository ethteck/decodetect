The Armory is a historic site in Key West, Florida, United States.  It is located at 600 White Street. In 1971, it was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places.
The armory was built to support military training and readiness of local military reserves. In 1877, the "Key West Rifles", a voluntary military company, organized with 80 members. It was not very professional, and after the fire of 1886 destroyed all of its equipment, it ceased to exist.  In 1888, a 32-member company named the "Island City Guards" was organized, which would eventually become Company 1, Second Regiment of Infantry, Florida State Troops. It is now part of the National Guard.Land for an armory was purchased by Monroe County in 1901. The armory was designed by T. F. Russell and built in 1901 by John T. Sawyer. In 1903, upon a ruling by the Florida Supreme Court, the state of Florida refunded the cost to the county and took ownership.In 2006, it became the home and initial campus of The Studios of Key West, a new artist community offering creative space, professional workshops, and other creative and cultural activities.
